I&#x27;ve never been afraid of flying before.  My best guess is that it&#x27;s either all the news about the 737 MAX or the fact that I work at a large tech company and see the huge number of bugs that even really good software engineers make.<p>I&#x27;ve flown frequently ever since I was young, and I currently average about 8-10 flights per year for work, vacation, or visiting family.  I have another flight coming up in a week and am tempted to take a $400 loss just because the thought of getting on a plane again is making me feel sick.  I&#x27;ve always heard that the best way to eliminate a fear is to face it frequently, but in my case, it seems the more I fly, the more anxious I become.<p>I&#x27;m aware of all the statistics (e.g., you&#x27;re more likely to die in a car crash on the way to the airport than during your flight), but logic doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bearing on my emotions during the flight.<p>Thanks for any help!', 'time': 1554737971, 'title': 'Ask HN: Suddenly afraid of flying, not sure why or what to do about it', 'type': 'story'}\n",

I would be curious to hear your input, what works and what doesn&#x27;t in your opinion. Evaluation methodologies I have often seen are:<p>- Demonstration of impact on business: In this case it&#x27;s up to the data scientist to justify as best as possible what business decision (or internal milestone) was made because of an analysis performed. In theory it makes sense (= your focus should be on impacting business), in practice I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a single analysis changing the course of anything; decisions are driven by many factors, your analysis being only one of them.<p>- Tool usage: I guess some programmers are evaluated the same way; basically, you develop a tool for co-workers to perform analyses with. The more the tool is used, the better it is for you (it&#x27;s assumed that high usage = high business relevance). In this case the usage is sometimes easier to track and more impartial, but it&#x27;s often difficult to develop a data science tool covering many use-cases, and one frequently ends-up with a niche product with low usage.', 'time': 1554711193, 'title': 'Ask HN: Data scientists, how are you being evaluated within your company?', 'type': 'story'}\n",

I would like to ask you guys for some advice. Up until recently, I was vaguely aware of one of my friends being involved in some side business. Just yesterday, I found out that the business - a startup - was going to use blockchains for whatever reason. Not only that, he is the founder of said startup! His team has received some investment and has conducted a blockchain workshop or two, and they seem to have no signs of stopping.<p>Now, I know that there are probably blockchain and cryptocurrency advocates among the HN crowd. That being said, I am skeptical about him running a startup that focuses solely on blockchains. The problems he wants to address (e.g. fraud prevention in charity money transactions) could be easily solved using conventional databases with basic security measures. While I laud my friend for embarking on this venture, I can&#x27;t help but feel as if this will lead nowhere. His team is basing their tech stack off an open source blockchain developed for a Chinese cryptocurrency, though they are not in charge of it directly - they have an IT team for that.<p>Both of us are still university students. I have no intention of discouraging him, but at the same time, I would like to nudge him in the right direction. Feel free to ask any questions, but please note that I won&#x27;t bring up any names unless absolutely necessary. I would really like to hear your take on this.<p>Thanks!', 'time': 1554683817, 'title': \"Ask HN: My friend is a founder of a blockchain startup. I'm skeptical. What now?\", 'type': 'story'}\n",

This brings communication benefits that other productivity tools fundamentally cannot provide. Wherever you are working, you can essentially pull up a chair next to your coworker to see and discuss what they are working on.<p>This live code view leads to a many other productivity benefits. Existing tools will let you know your teammates&#x27; task, but not the exact lines of code they are modifying. CoDiff on the other hand, can notify you in real-time when you conflict with one of your teammates. This greatly reduces the time spent in resolving merge conflicts, prevents duplicated work, and unobtrusively improves productivity.<p>In the future, CoDiff will integrate with your favorite editors and other productivity tools for even greater benefits. A few examples: get conflict notifications in your IDE, set statuses according to Trello task, and share links to live code snippets on Slack.<p>We currently have the first <i>alpha</i> build available on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codiff.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codiff.com</a>. It’s completely free now and we would be extremely grateful for anyone to try it out.

Current assumption is that features will be copied 1:1, so the domain is well known. We will have a dedicated tester or two as well.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a lightweight process to run this project with around 3-4 other developers. Specifically I want to use existing tools: Atlassian JIRA, Stash and Bamboo.

My best guess is that it&#x27;s either all the news about the 737 MAX or the fact that I work at a large tech company and see the huge number of bugs that even really good software engineers make.<p>I&#x27;ve flown frequently ever since I was young, and I currently average about 8-10 flights per year for work, vacation, or visiting family.  I have another flight coming up in a week and am tempted to take a $400 loss just because the thought of getting on a plane again is making me feel sick.

The more the tool is used, the better it is for you (it&#x27;s assumed that high usage = high business relevance).

This brings communication benefits that other productivity tools fundamentally cannot provide. Wherever you are working, you can essentially pull up a chair next to your coworker to see and discuss what they are working on.<p>This live code view leads to a many other productivity benefits. Existing tools will let you know your teammates&#x27; task, but not the exact lines of code they are modifying. CoDiff on the other hand, can notify you in real-time when you conflict with one of your teammates. This greatly reduces the time spent in resolving merge conflicts, prevents duplicated work, and unobtrusively improves productivity.<p>In the future, CoDiff will integrate with your favorite editors and other productivity tools for even greater benefits. A few examples: get conflict notifications in your IDE, set statuses according to Trello task, and share links to live code snippets on Slack.<p>We currently have the first <i>alpha</i> build available on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codiff.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codiff.com</a>. It’s completely free now and we would be extremely grateful for anyone to try it out. We never touch your git repository - no extra branches or commits - we are read only.<p>We are looking for feedback at this point to help shape the future of the product–on the idea, the app, the workflow, or new directions.
